A state-of-the-art implementation of Poisson Image Editing with advanced features for seamless image compositing. This system provides **significantly better results** than traditional methods through multi-scale processing, intelligent content analysis, and advanced blending techniques.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Advanced Processing Techniques
- **Multi-Scale Poisson Blending**: Uses image pyramids for processing at multiple resolutions
- **Intelligent Content Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of image characteristics for optimal placement
- **Enhanced Mask Generation**: Combines multiple computer vision techniques for precise object extraction
- **Advanced Color Correction**: Automatic color matching in perceptually uniform color spaces
- **Edge-Aware Processing**: Gradient-based refinement for superior boundary handling

### Multiple Blending Modes
- **Seamless**: Preserves source image colors and lighting characteristics
- **Mixed Gradients**: Intelligently chooses the best gradients from both images
- **Monochrome Transfer**: Transfers only structure while preserving target colors

### User-Friendly Interface
- **Automatic Mode**: AI-powered processing with minimal user input
- **Interactive Mode**: Full manual control with intelligent assistance
- **Batch Processing**: Compare multiple blend modes simultaneously
- **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side traditional vs. enhanced results

## 📊 Performance Improvements

## 📖 Mathematical Background

The system is based on Poisson Image Editing as described in:
> Pérez, Patrick, Michel Gangnet, and Andrew Blake. "Poisson image editing." ACM SIGGRAPH 2003 Papers. 2003.

**Core Equation**: ∇²f = div(v) over Ω with f|∂Ω = f*|∂Ω

Where:
- `f` is the result image
- `v` is the guidance vector field
- `Ω` is the interior region
- `∂Ω` is the boundary
